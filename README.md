# system-programming-coursework

This repository contains all the C programs I wrote during my system programming course in Spring 2021. 

This course is about learning the features of the Linux/Unix operating system such as working with the shell, using text editors like vim and emacs, and understanding the Linux Kernel.

I learned a great deal about the linux operating system throughout this course and it motivated me to finally utilize command-line tools in my development workflow.

Professor Briskman, if you are reading this, thank you so much!
