# What I learned from this homework:

* Linux environment and its tree-like file system
* How to navigate around the file system using commands 
* How to compile and run a C program 

## Project Setup

#### Download C program from server with wget command
```
wget http://www.sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~briskman/cisc3350/c_files/prog1.c
```

#### Compile C program with gcc command
```c
gcc -Wall -Wextra -O2 -g -o prog1 prog1.c
```

#### Run the C program from its directory

```
