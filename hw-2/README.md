# What I created

- This is a simple C program that mimics the functionality of a cat command which reads the contents of file(s) specified as command line arguments

# What I learned

- C library functions
- The essence of a function: input, process, output
- Variable vs pointer
- Command-line arguments 

## Project Setup

#### Compile C program with gcc
```C
gcc -Wall -Wextra -o2 -g -o my_cat my_cat.c
```

#### Run program from its directory
```C
./my_cat <files-seperated-by-space>
```
